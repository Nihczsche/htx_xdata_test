# HTX xData Test

This repository is to host the solutions for the HTX xData technical test for the data scientist role. It comprises 3 sections, each placed in separate folders:

1. asr folder contains the solutions for Q2. 
2. asr-train folder contains the solutions for Q3. Working notebook for deriving Q4 report is stored here.
3. hotword-detection folder contains the solutions for Q5.

Dockerfile for Q2(e) is placed in the main repository. 
Solution for Q4 is placed in the main repository as training-report.pdf.
Solution for Q6 is placed in the main repository as essay-ssl.pdf.

# Question 1

.gitignore files and requirements.txt are placed in the main repository together with this README.md file. The requirements file lists all the packages used for the entire test.

# Question 2

Q2(a) to (c) solution is provided in asr/asr_api.py. To run the API web server, use the following steps:
1. pip install all the packages listed in the asr/requirements.txt file (pip install --upgrade -r asr/requirements.txt)
2. From the main directory, open a terminal and run the command: "uvicorn asr.asr_api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001"
3. In a browser, you may access http://localhost:8001/docs to view the relevant API documentation

Q2(d) solution is generated by running the following command in the terminal from the main directory:
python asr/cv-decode.py --directory <path to common_voice/cv-valid-dev/> --csv-input <path to common_voice/cv-valid-dev.csv> --csv-output asr/cv-valid-dev.csv
The output csv is provided in asr/cv-valid-dev.csv

For Q2(e), from the parent directory, first build the docker image with the following command:
docker build . -t asr-api:v1
To start a container, use the following command:
docker run -p 8001:8001 --name <container name> -d asr-api:v1
The container would need some time to cache the model, hence it is recommended to wait a while before using the API.

# Question 3

Q3(a) and Q3(c) solution is provided in asr-train/cv-train-2a.ipynb

For Q3(b), the checkpoint from pytorch is zipped for future inference. Due to its large size, it is not uploaded into the repository.

# Question 4

Q4 solution is placed in the main repository as training-report.pdf.

# Question 5

Q5(a) solution is provided in hotword-detection/cv-hotword-5a.ipynb. The output text file is as shown in hotword-detection/detected.txt.

Q5(b) solution is provided in hotword-detection/cv-hotword-similarity-5b.ipynb. The output csv file with the similarity boolean column is as shown in hotword-detection/cv-valid-dev.csv.

# Question 6

Q6 solution is placed in the main repository as essay-ssl.pdf.
